12|my child arrived just the other day 
15|he came to the world in the usual way 
18|but there were planes to catch 
21|and bills to pay 
22|he learned to walk while I was away
24|and he was talking 'fore a knew it, 
26|and as he grew 
28|he'd say, "I'm going to be like you, dad
30|You know I'm going to be like you"

35|and the cat's in the cradle 
37|and the silver spoon 
39|little boy blue and the man on the moon 
41|"When you comin' home, Dad?"
44|"I don't know when, but we'll get together then 
47|you know we'll have a good time then"

60|my son turned ten just the other day 
63|he said, "Thanks for the ball, dad, 
65|come on let's play 
66|can you teach me to throw?" 
68|I said-a, "Not today 
69|I got a lot to do.", He said, "That's okay" 
72|and he walked away 
74|but his smile never dimmed
76|It said, "I'm gonna be like him, yeah
78|you know I'm gonna be like him" 


82|and the cat's in the cradle 
84|and the silver spoon
86|little boy blue and the man on the moon 
88|"When you comin' home, Dad?"
91|"I don't know when, but we'll get together then 
94|you know we'll have a good time then"

107|well, he came from college 
109|just the other day 
110|so much like a man I just had to say 
112|"Son, I'm proud of you, 
114|can you sit for a while?" 
116|he shook his head 
117|and he said with a smile 
119|"What I'd really like, Dad, 
120|is to borrow the car keys 
122|see you later, can I have them please?"

125|and the cat's in the cradle 
127|and the silver spoon 
129|little boy blue and the man on the moon 
131|"When you're coming home, son?"
134|"I don't know when, but we'll get together then 
137|you know we'll have a good time then"

156|I've long since retired, my son's moved away 
159|I called him up just the other day 
163|I said, "I'd like to see you 
165|if you don't mind" 
167|he said, "I'd love to, Dad, 
169|if I can find the time 
171|you see my new job's a hassle 
173|and the kids have the flu 
175|but it's sure nice talking to you, Dad 
177|it's been sure nice talking to you 
182|and as I hung up the phone
184|it occurred to me 
186|he'd grown up just like me 
188|my boy was just like me 

193|and the cat's in the cradle 
195|and the silver spoon 
197|little boy blue and the man on the moon 
199|"When you comin' home, son?" 
202|"I don't know when, but we'll get together then, 
205|we're gonna have a good time then"
