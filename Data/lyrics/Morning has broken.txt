13|Morning has broken like the first morning
21|Blackbird has spoken like the first bird
30|Praise for the singing, 
34|praise for the morning
38|Praise for them springing 
42|fresh from the world

54|Sweet the rains new fall, 
59|sunlit from Heaven
63|Like the first dewfall 
67|on the first grass
71|Praise for the sweetness 
75|of the wet garden
79|Sprung in completeness 
83|where His feet pass

99|Mine is the sunlight, 
104|mine is the morning
108|Born of the one light, 
112|Eden saw play
116|Praise with elation, 
120|praise every morning
124|God's recreation of the new day

143|Morning has broken like the first morning
151|Blackbird has spoken like the first bird
160|Praise for the singing, 
164|praise for the morning
168|Praise for them springing 
172|fresh from the world
