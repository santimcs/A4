29|When you were born into this world
33|Your mom and dad saw a dream fulfilled
36|Dream come true
38|The answer to their prayers

44|You were to them a special child
48|Gave them joy every time you smiled
51|Each time you cried
53|They're at your side to care
58|
58|Child, you don't know, you'll never know
61|How far they'd go, to give you all
65|Their love can give

71|To see you through and God it's true
74|They'd die for you, if they must
78|To see you live

84|How many seasons came and went
88|So many years have now been spent
91|For time ran fast
93|And now at last you're strong

101|Now what has gotten over you
104|You seem to hate your parents too
107|Speak out your mind
109|Why do you find them wrong

114|Child, you don't know, you'll never know
117|How far they'd go, to give you all
121|Their love can give

126|To see you through and God it's true
129|They die for you, if they must 
133|To see you live

141|And now your path has gone astray
143|Child, you ain't sure what to do or say
146|You're so alone, no friends are on your side

155|And child you now break down in tears
158|Let them drive away your fears
162|Where must you go
164|Their arms stay open wide
169|
169|Child, you don't know, you'll never know
172|How far they'd go, to give you all
176|Their love can give

183|To see you through and God it's true
186|They'd die for you, if they must 
190|To see you live

194|Child, you don't know, you'll never know
197|How far they'd go, to give you all
201|Their love can give

206|To see you through and God it's true
210|They'd die for you, if they must
214|To see you live ...
