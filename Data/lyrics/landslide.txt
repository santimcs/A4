14|I took my love, took it down
19|Climbed a mountain, and I turned around
24|And I saw my reflection 
27|in the snow-covered hills
30|Till the landslide brought me down

36|Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
42|Can the child within my heart rise above?
48|Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
54|Can I handle the seasons of my life?

72|Well, I've been afraid of changing
77|'Cause I've built my life around you
83|But time makes you bolder, 
87|even children get older
91|And I'm getting older too

120|Well, I've been afraid of changing
125|'Cause I've built my life around you
132|But time makes you bolder, 
136|even children get older
139|And I'm getting older too
144|Oh, I'm getting older too

151|Ah, take my love, take it down
156|Oh, climb a mountain and turn around
163|And if you see my reflection 
166|in the snow-covered hills
169|Well, the landslide will bring you down

175|And if you see my reflection 
178|in the snow covered hills
182|Well, the landslide will bring you down
187|Oh, the landslide will bring it down
