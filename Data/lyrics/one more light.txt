27|Should've stayed,
30|Were there signs I ignored?
38|Can I help you not to hurt any more?
49|We saw brilliance when the world was asleep
62|There are things that we can have
67|But can't keep

69|If they say
72|Who cares if one more light goes out?
76|In the sky of a million stars
82|It flickers, flickers
84|Who cares when someone's time runs out?
86|If a moment is all we are
93|Or quicker, quicker
95|Who cares if one more light goes out?
100|Well, I do

107|The reminders pull the floor from your feet
117|In the kitchen,
121|One more chair than you need, oh
128|And you're angry, and you should be,
135|It's not fair
139|Just 'cause you can't see it
143|Doesn't mean it isn't there

150|If they say
153|Who cares if one more light goes out?
157|In the sky of a million stars
163|It flickers, flickers
165|Who cares when someone's time runs out?
167|If a moment is all we are
174|Or quicker, quicker
176|Who cares if one more light goes out?
181|Well I do

208|Who cares if one more light goes out?
212|In the sky of a million stars
217|It flickers, flickers
220|Who cares when someone's time runs out?
223|If a moment is all we are
228|Or quicker, quicker
231|Who cares if one more light goes out?
236|Well, I do
243|Well, I do
